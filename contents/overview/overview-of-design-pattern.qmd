title: "Overview of Design Patterns"

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced developers, providing a shared vocabulary for designing flexible and maintainable code.

## Creational Patterns

Control **how objects are created**, hiding the creation logic to make the system more flexible.

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Factory Method** | Delegate instantiation to subclasses |
| **Abstract Factory** | Create families of related objects |
| **Builder** | Construct complex objects step by step |
| **Prototype** | Clone existing objects |
| **Singleton** | Ensure only one instance exists |

## Structural Patterns

Define **how objects are composed** to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Adapter** | Make incompatible interfaces work together |
| **Bridge** | Separate abstraction from implementation |
| **Composite** | Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly |
| **Decorator** | Add responsibilities dynamically |
| **Facade** | Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem |
| **Flyweight** | Share common state between objects |
| **Proxy** | Control access to an object |

## Behavioral Patterns

Define **how objects interact** and distribute responsibilities.

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Pass requests along a chain of handlers |
| **Command** | Encapsulate requests as objects |
| **Iterator** | Access elements sequentially without exposing structure |
| **Mediator** | Reduce direct dependencies between objects |
| **Memento** | Capture and restore object state |
| **Observer** | Notify dependents of state changes |
| **State** | Alter behavior when internal state changes |
| **Strategy** | Define interchangeable algorithms |
| **Template Method** | Define algorithm skeleton, defer steps to subclasses |
| **Visitor** | Add operations without modifying classes |
